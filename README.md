# Peoplebox-python-exercise

As a part of this analysis exercise, I have considered below fields for the transformation:

'EMP_ID,MANAGER_ID,ACTIVITY,EFFECTIVE_DATE,END_DATE,RATINGS_IF_ANY,COMPENSATION_IF_ANY,COMMENT'

This python program expects the input file to be present at - '~/Downloads/input.csv'
and generates output at - '/tmp/output.csv'

As a pre-requisite to run this program, a pandas library must have been installed

The comment column thats added gives lots of useful information on why the values been transformed the way been populated. There are many more enhancement can be done, but in the interest of the time, keeping it within limited scope without doing over engineering.

Find attached output file for results
